### WES: Whole-exome sequencing to identify novel drive mutation for human cancers


* 07/27/2019, [MutationalPatterns](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MutationalPatterns.html) enter into the pipeline in BIRC10-LC and CHG1
* 07/26/2019, [sequenza](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sequenza/index.html) enter into the pipeline in BIRC10-LC and CHG1




We detected somatic SVs from WGS using CREST23, and performed integrative SV/CNA detection using CONSERTING24 to identify subclonal or complex SVs linked to CNAs. For comparison purposes, we also performed CNA analysis on WES using the Sequenza algorithm
